# Abstract
This mini-course intends to present a holistic introduction to the finite element method (FEM), 
which is arguably the most popular and most powerful numerical method for solving partial differential equations (PDEs). 
Both boundary value problems (for elliptic PDEs) and initial–boundary value problems (for parabolic and hyperbolic PDEs) will be considered in the course. 
Following the historic development of the FEM, it will be introduced within a more general Galerkin and Petrov-Galerkin framework. 
The focuses of the course are to introduce/explain the main ideas/ingredients of the FEM and its variants/extensions (such as nonconforming methods, mixed methods, 
least squares methods) as well as the main techniques for the convergence analysis. Due to the time constraint. 
The construction of FE spaces and their interpolation theory will only be briefly covered, so is the Sobolev space theory. 
Unlike the popular presentation of the materials which assumes the coercivity of the underlying PDE problem (or bilinear form) in a Hilbert space setting, 
this mini-course adopts an approach which relies on the weak coercivity (i.e., inf-sup/LBB condition) and is formulated in a Banach space setting. If time permits, 
connection of the FEM to discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods and mixed finite element methods will also be discussed. 
Applications of the FEM to be covered include the Stokes and Navier-Stokes equations for incompressible fluids and the Lame’s equations for linear elasticity. 
Finally, solution methods (i.e., solvers) and computer implementation of the FEM will also be briefly discussed.
