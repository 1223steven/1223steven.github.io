This is an introduction to use ifem from [Long Chen](https://www.math.uci.edu/~chenlong/) UC Irvine. It can be obtain form [ifem package](https://www.math.uci.edu/~chenlong/programming.html) which is a MATLAB software package to use finite element methods.


Introduction to iFEM
======
iFEM is a MATLAB software package containing robust, efficient, and easy-following codes for the main building blocks of adaptive finite element methods and multigrid methods on unstructured simplicial grids in both two and three dimensions. Besides the simplicity and readability, sparse matrixlization, an innovative programming style for MATLAB, is introduced to improve the efficiency.
