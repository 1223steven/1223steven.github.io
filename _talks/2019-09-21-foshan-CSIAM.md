In this talk, we will introduce a second-order semi-implicit projection methods for Landau-Lifschitz model in micromagnetics and give some main theoretical results, 
which are unconditional unique solvability and optimal rate convergence analysis. 
Here, we will present some numerical examples to verify the second-order convergence rate both in time and space. <br>
