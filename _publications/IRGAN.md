## Abstract
Micromagnetics simulations require accurate approximation of the magnetization dynamics described by the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation, which is nonlinear, nonlocal, and has a non-convex constraint, posing interesting challenges
in developing numerical methods. In this paper, we propose two second-order
semi-implicit projection methods based on the second-order backward differentiation formula and the second-order interpolation formula using the information at previous two temporal steps. Unconditional unique solvability of both
methods is proved, with their second-order accuracy verified through numerical
examples in both 1D and 3D. The efficiency of both methods is compared to
that of another two popular methods. In addition, we test the robustness of
both methods for the first benchmark problem with a ferromagnetic thin film
material from National Institute of Standards and Technology.
